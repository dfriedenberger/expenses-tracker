- [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (only for local development)


### Configure .env and liquibase.properties
Use .env.template and liquibase.properties.template and modify your environment

### Create Database 
```sh
docker-compose up db liquibase
```

```sh
docker exec -it <container> bash
